/** variables:
    * 1. are a container of data that can be assigned or left unassigned at time of declaration.
    * 2. they are named identifiers bound to a section of our code called a scope.
    * 3. called variables because unlike constants, variables can be reassigned another value.
    * 4. they can be strings, number or boolean.
    * 5. they can be contain primitave values like bool, number or strings.
    * 6. they also can contain complex value like an array, object or function.
    * 7. they either store simple data (no more that 8 bytes) like bool, num or string or
    *    point to a location in memory where weve stored a complex value like object, array or function.

// 1. declaration //
//      at the declaration phase, the variable myName is undefined because we havent initialized it to anything
var myName;
console.log(myName); // prints undefined to the console
// 2. initialization is when you give it a value
myName = "dahlak"; 
console.log(myName); // prints "dahlak" to console
// 3. reassigning an already initialized variable
myName = "keleta";
console.log(nyName); //prints keleta to console
