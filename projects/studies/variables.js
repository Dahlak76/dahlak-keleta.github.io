/** variables:
    * are a container of data that can be assigned or left unassigned at time of declaration.
    * they are named identifiers bound to a section of our code called a scope.
    * called variables because unlike constants, variables can be reassigned another value.
    * they can be strings, number or boolean.
    * they can be contain primitave values like bool, number or strings.
    * they also can contain complex value like an array, object or function.
    * they either store simple data (no more that 8 bytes) like bool, num or string or
    * point to a location in memory where weve stored a complex value like object, array or function.
