/**
 * Data Types:
 * 1. we use data types to be able to operate on variables, it is important to know something about the type.
 * 2. there are simple and complex data types
 * 3. simple data types are...
 * string, boolean, NaN, undefined, number and null
 * -they are atomic and immutable. they do not hold, collect or agregate other values.
 *  simple values return simple values, they do not alter the original value
 * -they also copy by value. when assigning or passing, simple data types are copied from one variable to another
 *  as long as they are simple and no more than 8 bytes in size
 * 4. compllex data types are...
 * functions, objects and arrays
 * -they aggregate other values and can be of indefinite size
 * -when assigniing or passing, complex data types are passed by refrence. 
 *  meaning the variable only contains the address where the data is stored.

// string- characters inside quotation marks
var data = "string"; // => prints "string"

// number- any integer positive or negative
var num = 1; // => prints 1

// boolean- true or false are the only oplions
var truthy = true; // => prints true

// NaN- not a number. prints NaN when a value isnt a number
NaN === NaN // => prints false

// null- The value null represents the intentional absence of any object value. 
//      It is one of JavaScript's primitive values and is treated as falsy for boolean operations.
var foo = null;
foo; // => prints null

// undefined- A variable that has not been assigned a value has the value undefined
var name; // => prints undefined

// boolean- Boolean represents a logical entity and can have two values: true and false
var age = 21;
if(age >= 20){
    return true;
}       // => prints true

// object- stores various keyed collections in no particular order by key/value pairs contained by {}
var dahlak = {
    name: "dahlak",
    age: 44,
    tall: yes
}; // dahlak object with name key with "dahlak" string as value, age key with number value and tall key with a boolean value

// array- has indexed list-like objects
var friends = ["dahlak", "kristin", "alex"];
// friends object with 3 properties with 3 indexes starting at dahlak in the 0 index

//function- set of statements that perform a task or calculate a value
function myFunction(num1, num2) {
    return num1 * num2;  
//  The function returns the product of num1 and num2
}
// infinity and -infinity- 
// Infinity is a property of the global object. In other words, it is a variable in global scope.
// Infinity is a numeric value that represents positive infinity.

//-Infinity is a numeric value that represents negative infinity.

// Infinity is displayed when a number exceeds the upper limit of the floating point numbers, which is 1.797693134862315E+308.

//-Infinity is displayed when a number exceeds the lower limit of the floating point numbers, which is -1.797693134862316E+308.
