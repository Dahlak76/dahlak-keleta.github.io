/**loops:
 * 1. Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly
 * 2. There are many different kinds of loops, but they all essentially 
 *      do the same thing: they repeat an action some number of times
 * 3. A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false
 * 4.lets cover two of the more commonly used loops, a for loop and a for in loop
 */
 //a. The initializing expression initialExpression, if any, is executed. 
 //     This expression usually initializes one or more loop counters, but the syntax allows 
 //     an expression of any degree of complexity. This expression can also declare variables.
 //  *this is also considered the start coondition where the count or itteration will start
 //b. The conditionExpression expression is evaluated. If the value of conditionExpression is true, 
 //     the loop statements execute. If the value of condition is false, the for loop terminates. 
 //     (If the condition expression is omitted entirely, the condition is assumed to be true.)
 //  *this is the stop condition. as long as this statement is true, the loop will continue itterating.
 //c. The statement executes. To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group those statements.
 //d. If present, the update expression incrementExpression is executed.
 //  *this is the part that tells the loop by what increment to count/loop
 //e. Control returns to Step 2. 

 var nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
 for(var i = 0; i < nums.length; i++){ // i has been declared and starts the loop at 0 and continues to length of the array by increments of 1
    console.log(nums[i]);               // prints =>    1
 }                                      //              2
                                        //              3
                                        //              4
                                        //              5
//a for in loop is good for looping through objects and accessing keys and values
// two steps to define a for loop: how will you define the key and what object do you want to loop over
//  key reference and object
 for(var key in object){
    //code to run
